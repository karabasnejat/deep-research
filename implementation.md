# Implementation Plan: Deep Research Agent

This document breaks down the development of the Deep Research Agent (as described in the PRD) into actionable sub-tasks. Each section corresponds to a major component or milestone, with sub-tasks listed in recommended order.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize project repository and directory structure as per PRD
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with initial dependencies (Streamlit, LangChain, etc.)
- [ ] Set up `.env` for API keys
- [ ] Add `README.md` with project overview

## 2. UI Skeleton (Streamlit)
- [ ] Create `streamlit_app.py` with basic layout
- [ ] Implement input for topic entry and research start button
- [ ] Add placeholder panels: Chat, Report, Chain-of-Thought, Memory
- [ ] Add settings panel for API keys

## 3. Agent Orchestration
- [ ] Implement `orchestrator/manager.py` to coordinate agent flow
- [ ] Create `planner.py`, `researcher.py`, `writer.py` agent modules with basic class structure
- [ ] Define agent interfaces and data flow

## 4. Tool Integrations
- [ ] Implement `tools/web_search.py` (SerpAPI wrapper)
- [ ] Implement `tools/acad_search.py` (ArXiv/PubMed wrapper)
- [ ] Add error handling and API key management

## 5. Memory Modules
- [ ] Implement `memory/short_term.py` (buffer, trim, summary logic)
- [ ] Implement `memory/long_term.py` (vector store integration: Chroma/FAISS/Pinecone)
- [ ] Add retrieval and update functions

## 6. Chain-of-Thought Logging
- [ ] Define JSON log schema for agent steps
- [ ] Implement logging in each agent module
- [ ] Write logs to `logs/chain_of_thought.json`

## 7. UI: Dynamic Panels
- [ ] Connect Streamlit UI to backend logic
- [ ] Display chat history and agent notes
- [ ] Show report sections as they are generated
- [ ] Visualize chain-of-thought logs (expanders, timeline)
- [ ] List short-term and long-term memory contents

## 8. Advanced Features & Polish
- [ ] Asynchronous/parallel agent execution
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback
- [ ] UI/UX improvements (styling, usability)
- [ ] Add prompt templates in `utils/prompts.py`
- [ ] Add configuration management in `utils/config.py`

## 9. Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for core modules
- [ ] Update `README.md` with usage instructions
- [ ] Document API requirements and setup

## 10. Deployment & Optimization
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (Docker, Streamlit Cloud, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize performance (caching, batching)
- [ ] Final review and code cleanup
